<h2 id="241-identify-and-locate-the-major-anatomic-structures-within-the-abdominal-and-pelvic-cavities">24.1  Identify and locate the major anatomic structures within the abdominal and pelvic cavities.</h2>
<p>The <strong>abdominal</strong> and <strong>pelvic cavities</strong> contain several major anatomic structures, including organs, blood vessels, muscles, and connective tissues. Here's a detailed overview of the structures in each cavity:</p>
<h3 id="abdominal-cavity"><strong>Abdominal Cavity</strong></h3>
<p>The abdominal cavity is the upper part of the abdominopelvic cavity, located between the diaphragm and the pelvic cavity. It contains the following major structures:</p>
<h4 id="1-gastrointestinal-gi-tract">1. <strong>Gastrointestinal (GI) Tract</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Stomach</strong>: Located in the upper left quadrant, the stomach breaks down food using acid and enzymes.</li>
<li><strong>Small Intestine</strong>:<ul>
<li><strong>Duodenum</strong>: The first part, where most chemical digestion occurs.</li>
<li><strong>Jejunum and Ileum</strong>: The middle and lower parts, responsible for nutrient absorption.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Large Intestine (Colon)</strong>:<ul>
<li><strong>Ascending colon</strong>: Located on the right side.</li>
<li><strong>Transverse colon</strong>: Spans horizontally across the abdomen.</li>
<li><strong>Descending colon</strong>: Located on the left side.</li>
<li><strong>Sigmoid colon</strong>: Leads to the rectum.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Rectum</strong>: Stores waste before it is expelled from the body.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="2-liver">2. <strong>Liver</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>Located in the upper right quadrant, the liver is responsible for detoxification, protein synthesis, and producing bile, which aids in fat digestion.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="3-gallbladder">3. <strong>Gallbladder</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>Located beneath the liver, it stores and concentrates bile produced by the liver.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="4-pancreas">4. <strong>Pancreas</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>Located behind the stomach, the pancreas produces digestive enzymes and insulin, which regulates blood sugar levels.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="5-spleen">5. <strong>Spleen</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>Located in the upper left quadrant, the spleen filters blood, recycles red blood cells, and supports immune function.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="6-kidneys">6. <strong>Kidneys</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>Located on either side of the spine in the retroperitoneal space (behind the peritoneum), the kidneys filter blood to produce urine.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="7-adrenal-glands">7. <strong>Adrenal Glands</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>Located on top of each kidney, these glands produce hormones such as adrenaline and cortisol.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="8-peritoneum">8. <strong>Peritoneum</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>A double-layered membrane that lines the abdominal cavity and covers the abdominal organs, providing protection and support.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="pelvic-cavity"><strong>Pelvic Cavity</strong></h3>
<p>The pelvic cavity is located below the abdominal cavity, within the bony pelvis. It contains several vital organs, including parts of the urinary, reproductive, and digestive systems.</p>
<h4 id="1-urinary-system">1. <strong>Urinary System</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Bladder</strong>: Located in the lower pelvic cavity, it stores urine until it is expelled from the body.</li>
<li><strong>Ureters</strong>: Tubes that carry urine from the kidneys to the bladder.</li>
<li><strong>Urethra</strong>: The tube that carries urine from the bladder to the outside of the body.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="2-reproductive-system-males">2. <strong>Reproductive System (Males)</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Prostate Gland</strong>: Located just below the bladder, it produces fluid that nourishes and protects sperm.</li>
<li><strong>Seminal Vesicles</strong>: Located behind the bladder, they produce a component of semen.</li>
<li><strong>Vas Deferens</strong>: Tubes that transport sperm from the testes to the urethra.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="3-reproductive-system-females">3. <strong>Reproductive System (Females)</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Ovaries</strong>: Located on either side of the uterus, they produce eggs and hormones.</li>
<li><strong>Fallopian Tubes</strong>: Tubes that carry eggs from the ovaries to the uterus.</li>
<li><strong>Uterus</strong>: Located in the center of the pelvic cavity, the uterus is where a fertilized egg implants and develops during pregnancy.</li>
<li><strong>Vagina</strong>: A muscular canal that connects the uterus to the outside of the body.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="4-lower-gi-tract">4. <strong>Lower GI Tract</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Rectum</strong>: The final portion of the large intestine, located in the pelvic cavity, which stores feces until defecation.</li>
<li><strong>Anus</strong>: The external opening at the end of the digestive tract.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="5-major-blood-vessels">5. <strong>Major Blood Vessels</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Aorta</strong>: The largest artery in the body, which passes through the abdominal cavity and bifurcates into the iliac arteries, supplying blood to the pelvis and lower limbs.</li>
<li><strong>Inferior Vena Cava</strong>: The large vein that returns deoxygenated blood from the lower body to the heart.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="6-muscles">6. <strong>Muscles</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Pelvic Floor Muscles</strong>: A group of muscles that support the pelvic organs and control the release of urine and feces.</li>
<li><strong>Psoas Muscle</strong>: A large muscle that runs from the lumbar spine to the femur, playing a role in hip flexion and posture.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3 id="summary-of-locations"><strong>Summary of Locations</strong>:</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Abdominal cavity</strong>: Contains the digestive organs (stomach, intestines, liver, pancreas), kidneys, and adrenal glands.</li>
<li><strong>Pelvic cavity</strong>: Contains the reproductive organs (ovaries, uterus, prostate), urinary organs (bladder, urethra), lower portion of the large intestine (rectum), and major blood vessels.</li>
</ul>
<p>These structures work together to perform essential functions related to digestion, elimination, reproduction, and hormonal balance.</p>
<h2 id="242-list-and-describe-at-least-six-abdominal-and-pelvic-injuries">24.2  List and describe at least six abdominal and pelvic injuries.</h2>
<p>Here are six common abdominal and pelvic injuries, including their descriptions, causes, and potential complications:</p>
<h3 id="1-liver-laceration">1. <strong>Liver Laceration</strong></h3>

<h2 id="243-describe-and-demonstrate-how-to-assess-a-patient-with-abdominal-or-pelvic-trauma">24.3  Describe and demonstrate how to assess a patient with abdominal or pelvic trauma.</h2>
<p>Assessing a patient with <strong>abdominal or pelvic trauma</strong> is crucial for identifying life-threatening injuries and determining the next steps for management. The evaluation includes a <strong>primary survey</strong>, <strong>secondary survey</strong>, and detailed examination of the abdomen and pelvis to identify signs of injury, bleeding, or shock. Below is a step-by-step guide on how to assess a patient with abdominal or pelvic trauma.</p>
<h3 id="1-primary-survey-abcde-approach"><strong>1. Primary Survey (ABCDE Approach)</strong></h3>
<p>The primary survey is a quick assessment to identify life-threatening conditions.</p>
<h4 id="a-airway"><strong>A: Airway</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Assess airway patency</strong>: Ensure the patient’s airway is clear and unobstructed.</li>
<li><strong>Cervical spine precautions</strong>: If there is suspicion of a spinal injury (e.g., from a car accident or fall), immobilize the cervical spine.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="b-breathing"><strong>B: Breathing</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Assess breathing</strong>: Check respiratory rate, effort, and symmetry of chest movements.</li>
<li><strong>Oxygen administration</strong>: If the patient is in respiratory distress, administer high-flow oxygen.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="c-circulation"><strong>C: Circulation</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Check circulation and perfusion</strong>: Assess heart rate, blood pressure, capillary refill, and skin color.</li>
<li><strong>Look for signs of shock</strong>: These may include pale, cool, and clammy skin, low blood pressure, rapid heart rate (tachycardia), and decreased level of consciousness.</li>
<li><strong>Control external bleeding</strong>: Apply pressure to any visible wounds or bleeding sites.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="d-disability"><strong>D: Disability</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Neurological assessment</strong>: Check the patient’s level of consciousness (use the AVPU scale: Alert, Verbal, Pain, Unresponsive), and assess pupil response.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="e-exposure-and-environment"><strong>E: Exposure and Environment</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Expose the abdomen and pelvis</strong> to inspect for obvious signs of trauma (e.g., bruising, distension, lacerations).</li>
<li><strong>Maintain body temperature</strong>: Prevent hypothermia by covering the patient after the examination.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3 id="2-secondary-survey-focused-assessment"><strong>2. Secondary Survey (Focused Assessment)</strong></h3>
<p>Once life-threatening injuries are addressed, conduct a more detailed <strong>secondary survey</strong>, focusing on the abdomen and pelvis.</p>
<h4 id="1-history-ample"><strong>1. History (AMPLE)</strong></h4>
<p>Gather a quick patient history using the <strong>AMPLE</strong> acronym:
- <strong>A</strong>: Allergies
- <strong>M</strong>: Medications
- <strong>P</strong>: Past medical history
- <strong>L</strong>: Last meal
- <strong>E</strong>: Events leading to the trauma (e.g., car accident, fall)</p>
<h4 id="2-inspection"><strong>2. Inspection</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Look for external signs of trauma</strong>:</li>
<li>Bruising (e.g., <strong>Cullen’s sign</strong> around the umbilicus or <strong>Grey-Turner’s sign</strong> on the flanks, indicating internal bleeding).</li>
<li><strong>Distension</strong>: Abdominal swelling or distension, which could suggest internal bleeding or bowel injury.</li>
<li>Penetrating injuries, lacerations, or open wounds.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="3-auscultation"><strong>3. Auscultation</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Listen for bowel sounds</strong>: Absence of bowel sounds may indicate peritonitis or bowel injury, while hyperactive sounds may suggest a bowel obstruction.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="4-palpation"><strong>4. Palpation</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Palpate the abdomen</strong> systematically:</li>
<li>Gently press all four quadrants, assessing for tenderness, guarding (involuntary muscle contraction), or rebound tenderness (pain when pressure is released). This could indicate peritonitis or internal injury.</li>
<li><strong>Rigidity</strong>: A rigid abdomen may suggest peritonitis or internal bleeding.</li>
<li><strong>Masses or fluid</strong>: Palpable masses may indicate organ damage or bleeding. Fluid wave tests can help identify ascites (free fluid) in cases of injury.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="5-percussion"><strong>5. Percussion</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Percuss the abdomen</strong> to assess for:</li>
<li><strong>Tympany</strong>: A hollow sound may suggest bowel injury or gas in the abdomen (pneumoperitoneum).</li>
<li><strong>Dullness</strong>: Indicates fluid accumulation, which could be blood from internal hemorrhage (hemoperitoneum).</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="6-pelvic-assessment"><strong>6. Pelvic Assessment</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Palpate the pelvis</strong>:</li>
<li>Gently press the pelvic bones for <strong>tenderness, instability, or crepitus</strong> (grating sound), which could indicate a pelvic fracture.</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Do not forcefully manipulate</strong> the pelvis if you suspect a fracture, as this could exacerbate internal bleeding.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Check for blood</strong>:</p>
</li>
<li>Look for blood at the <strong>urinary meatus</strong> (opening of the urethra), which could indicate a bladder or urethral injury.</li>
<li>
<p>In women, assess for vaginal bleeding, which may indicate pelvic organ injury.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Assess lower extremities</strong>:</p>
</li>
<li>Check for signs of <strong>reduced circulation</strong> in the legs (cold, pale, or pulseless legs may indicate vascular injury).</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3 id="3-focused-assessment-with-sonography-for-trauma-fast-exam"><strong>3. Focused Assessment with Sonography for Trauma (FAST) Exam</strong></h3>
<p>A <strong>FAST exam</strong> is a bedside ultrasound that can quickly assess for internal bleeding or fluid in the following areas:
- <strong>Pericardial area</strong>: To check for blood around the heart (pericardial tamponade).
- <strong>Right upper quadrant</strong>: To check for blood near the liver and kidney (Morrison’s pouch).
- <strong>Left upper quadrant</strong>: To check for blood near the spleen.
- <strong>Pelvic area</strong>: To check for blood around the bladder or in the pelvic cavity.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="4-ongoing-monitoring"><strong>4. Ongoing Monitoring</strong></h3>
<p>After initial assessment and stabilization:
- <strong>Monitor vital signs</strong>: Continuously check for changes in blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, and level of consciousness.
- <strong>Reassess the abdomen and pelvis</strong> regularly for any signs of deterioration (e.g., increased pain, tenderness, or development of new symptoms).</p>
<h3 id="5-immediate-transport-or-surgical-referral"><strong>5. Immediate Transport or Surgical Referral</strong></h3>
<p>Patients with significant abdominal or pelvic trauma may require immediate transport to a trauma center for surgical intervention, particularly if there are signs of:
- Internal bleeding (shock, abdominal distension, tenderness).
- Pelvic fractures with hemodynamic instability.
- Signs of bowel perforation (rigid abdomen, absent bowel sounds).</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="demonstration-recap-lap-method-for-focused-assessment"><strong>Demonstration Recap (LAP Method for Focused Assessment)</strong></h3>
<ol>
<li><strong>Look</strong>: Inspect the abdomen and pelvis for bruising, distension, open wounds, or signs of bleeding.</li>
<li><strong>Auscultate</strong>: Listen to bowel sounds to detect abnormalities.</li>
<li><strong>Palpate</strong>: Gently palpate the abdomen and pelvis for tenderness, guarding, rigidity, or instability.</li>
</ol>
<p>By systematically following this approach, you can efficiently assess and manage a patient with abdominal or pelvic trauma.</p>
<h2 id="244-describe-and-demonstrate-how-to-manage-a-patient-with-abdominal-or-pelvic-trauma">24.4  Describe and demonstrate how to manage a patient with abdominal or pelvic trauma.</h2>
<p>Managing a patient with <strong>abdominal or pelvic trauma</strong> involves stabilizing the patient, preventing further injury, and preparing for transport to a higher level of care if necessary. Here is a step-by-step approach to managing these patients, including initial and ongoing care.</p>
<h3 id="1-primary-survey-and-initial-management-abcde-approach"><strong>1. Primary Survey and Initial Management (ABCDE Approach)</strong></h3>
<p>Begin with a <strong>primary survey</strong> to identify and address any life-threatening conditions.</p>
<h4 id="a-airway_1"><strong>A: Airway</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Ensure a clear airway</strong>: Position the patient to maintain a patent airway.</li>
<li><strong>Consider cervical spine precautions</strong>: If trauma is suspected, immobilize the cervical spine.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="b-breathing_1"><strong>B: Breathing</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Assess breathing</strong>: Check for adequate respiratory effort. Provide <strong>high-flow oxygen</strong> if there is any respiratory distress.</li>
<li><strong>Watch for signs of thoracic injury</strong>: Since some abdominal or pelvic injuries can extend to the thorax, be vigilant for chest trauma.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="c-circulation_1"><strong>C: Circulation</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Control any external bleeding</strong>: Apply direct pressure to control bleeding from wounds.</li>
<li><strong>Monitor signs of shock</strong>: Rapid heart rate, pale skin, weak pulse, and low blood pressure are indicators of shock. If shock is present:</li>
<li>Lay the patient flat, elevate their legs, and administer <strong>IV fluids</strong> (typically 1-2 liters of crystalloid fluids like normal saline or lactated Ringer’s) to maintain blood pressure.</li>
<li>Continuously monitor the patient’s vital signs, including heart rate, blood pressure, and oxygen saturation.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="d-disability_1"><strong>D: Disability</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Assess neurological status</strong>: Check the patient's level of consciousness using the <strong>AVPU scale</strong> (Alert, responds to Verbal stimuli, responds to Pain, Unresponsive) or <strong>Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS)</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="e-exposure-and-environment_1"><strong>E: Exposure and Environment</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Expose the abdomen and pelvis</strong>: Remove clothing to examine for injuries such as bruising, distension, open wounds, or obvious deformities.</li>
<li><strong>Prevent hypothermia</strong>: Keep the patient warm with blankets to avoid hypothermia, which can worsen shock.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3 id="2-secondary-survey-and-focused-examination"><strong>2. Secondary Survey and Focused Examination</strong></h3>
<p>After the primary survey, perform a more thorough <strong>secondary survey</strong> and focused assessment of the abdomen and pelvis.</p>
<h4 id="1-inspection"><strong>1. Inspection</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Look for external signs of trauma</strong>:</li>
<li><strong>Bruising and discoloration</strong> (e.g., Cullen's sign around the umbilicus or Grey-Turner’s sign on the flanks, which may indicate internal bleeding).</li>
<li><strong>Open wounds</strong>: Penetrating injuries (e.g., gunshot wounds, stab wounds).</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="2-palpation"><strong>2. Palpation</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Palpate the abdomen and pelvis</strong> for tenderness, rigidity, guarding, or masses.</li>
<li><strong>Tenderness</strong>: May indicate internal bleeding, bowel injury, or organ damage.</li>
<li><strong>Rebound tenderness</strong>: Pain upon release of pressure may suggest peritonitis.</li>
<li><strong>Pelvic stability</strong>: Gently check for pelvic instability (without excessive movement), which could indicate a pelvic fracture.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="3-auscultation_1"><strong>3. Auscultation</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Listen to bowel sounds</strong>: Absent bowel sounds may suggest peritonitis or bowel injury.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="4-percussion"><strong>4. Percussion</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Assess for dullness</strong>: This could indicate fluid accumulation, such as blood (hemoperitoneum).</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3 id="3-management-of-specific-injuries"><strong>3. Management of Specific Injuries</strong></h3>
<h4 id="1-internal-bleeding-hemoperitoneum"><strong>1. Internal Bleeding (Hemoperitoneum)</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Suspect internal bleeding</strong> if the patient has signs of shock (pale, cool skin, rapid heart rate, low blood pressure) without obvious external bleeding.</li>
<li><strong>Administer IV fluids</strong> to stabilize circulation and support blood pressure.</li>
<li><strong>Prepare for immediate transport</strong> to a trauma center for surgical intervention (e.g., exploratory laparotomy).</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="2-pelvic-fractures"><strong>2. Pelvic Fractures</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Immobilize the pelvis</strong>: Apply a <strong>pelvic binder</strong> or tightly wrap a sheet around the pelvis to stabilize the fracture and reduce the risk of further injury and internal bleeding.</li>
<li><strong>IV fluids</strong>: Administer IV fluids to prevent shock due to potential blood loss from the pelvic fracture.</li>
<li><strong>Monitor vital signs</strong> closely for signs of hypovolemic shock (tachycardia, hypotension).</li>
<li><strong>Do not over-manipulate the pelvis</strong>: Avoid moving the patient excessively until the pelvis is stabilized.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="3-penetrating-abdominal-trauma-eg-stab-or-gunshot-wounds"><strong>3. Penetrating Abdominal Trauma (e.g., Stab or Gunshot Wounds)</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Control external bleeding</strong>: Apply direct pressure to any visible wounds.</li>
<li><strong>Do not remove penetrating objects</strong>: If there is a foreign object (e.g., knife or impaled object), leave it in place and stabilize it with dressings to prevent further injury until the patient is in a controlled surgical environment.</li>
<li><strong>Monitor for signs of internal bleeding</strong>: Watch for hypotension, increasing abdominal pain, and abdominal distension.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="4-evisceration-protrusion-of-abdominal-contents"><strong>4. Evisceration (Protrusion of Abdominal Contents)</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Cover with moist sterile dressing</strong>: If abdominal contents (e.g., intestines) are protruding, cover the exposed organs with a sterile, moist dressing to prevent drying and infection. Do not attempt to push them back inside.</li>
<li><strong>Transport immediately</strong> for surgical intervention.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="5-blunt-abdominal-trauma"><strong>5. Blunt Abdominal Trauma</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Suspect internal organ damage</strong>: Even in the absence of external signs, internal organs like the liver, spleen, or kidneys may be damaged. Monitor for increasing abdominal pain, distension, and signs of shock.</li>
<li><strong>Administer fluids</strong>: IV fluids to support circulation in case of internal bleeding.</li>
<li><strong>Rapid transport</strong>: Patients with suspected blunt trauma and internal injuries should be transported rapidly to a trauma center for diagnostic imaging (e.g., FAST ultrasound, CT scan) and potential surgery.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3 id="4-ongoing-monitoring_1"><strong>4. Ongoing Monitoring</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Vital signs</strong>: Continuously monitor blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation.</li>
<li><strong>Reassess the abdomen and pelvis</strong> for increasing tenderness, distension, or worsening symptoms.</li>
<li><strong>Monitor for shock</strong>: If signs of shock worsen, consider the need for blood transfusion, especially in cases of internal bleeding or pelvic fractures.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3 id="5-definitive-care-and-transport"><strong>5. Definitive Care and Transport</strong></h3>
<p>In most cases of significant abdominal or pelvic trauma, the patient will require <strong>rapid transport</strong> to a trauma center for advanced imaging and surgical intervention.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>FAST exam</strong>: This bedside ultrasound can quickly detect free fluid (blood) in the abdominal cavity.</li>
<li><strong>CT scan</strong>: Used to evaluate the extent of internal injuries.</li>
<li><strong>Surgical intervention</strong>: May be required for injuries like bowel perforation, liver laceration, or pelvic fractures with vascular injury.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3 id="demonstration-recap"><strong>Demonstration Recap</strong></h3>

<h4 id="a-airway_2"><strong>A: Airway</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>Ensure the airway is clear and secure. If the patient is unconscious or has difficulty breathing, maintain the airway using basic maneuvers (e.g., jaw thrust, chin lift) or airway adjuncts.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="b-breathing_2"><strong>B: Breathing</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>Assess breathing and provide <strong>high-flow oxygen</strong> if needed.</li>
<li>Look for other signs of injury to the thorax or abdomen that might compromise breathing.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="c-circulation_2"><strong>C: Circulation</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Check circulation</strong> by assessing the patient’s pulse, skin color, temperature, and capillary refill.</li>
<li><strong>Control external bleeding</strong>: If there are any visible wounds or external bleeding, apply direct pressure to the site.</li>
<li><strong>Monitor for shock</strong>: Pelvic fractures can cause significant internal bleeding, leading to signs of shock such as pale or cool skin, rapid heart rate, low blood pressure, and confusion.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="d-disability_2"><strong>D: Disability</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>Assess neurological status using the <strong>AVPU scale</strong> (Alert, Verbal, Pain, Unresponsive) or <strong>Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS)</strong> to check the patient’s level of consciousness.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="e-exposure-and-environment_2"><strong>E: Exposure and Environment</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Expose the pelvis</strong> to assess for signs of injury (e.g., bruising, swelling, deformity). However, avoid excessive movement or manipulation of the pelvis to prevent further injury.</li>
<li>Keep the patient warm with blankets to prevent hypothermia, which can worsen shock.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3 id="3-do-not-manipulate-or-move-the-pelvis-excessively"><strong>3. Do Not Manipulate or Move the Pelvis Excessively</strong></h3>
